                        If you're planning to install signage on a commercial building in Singapore, understanding BCA
                        (Building and Construction Authority) approval requirements is critical. Getting it wrong can
                        mean costly delays, rejected submissions, and wasted fabrication costs.

                    <h2>What is BCA Approval?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is Singapore's statutory board that regulates the
                        building and construction industry. For signage, BCA approval ensures that any signs attached to
                        buildings meet structural safety standards and do not compromise the building's integrity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>BCA approval is separate from:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>URA approval</strong> — Required for conservation areas and certain shopfront
                            modifications</li>
                        <li><strong>Landlord/mall approval</strong> — Required by building owners or mall management
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Town Council approval</strong> — Required for HDB commercial spaces</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="article-callout">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Most commercial signage projects require BOTH BCA approval AND
                        landlord approval. Always check both requirements before starting.

                    <h2>The BCA Approval Process (7 Steps)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here's the complete step-by-step process for obtaining BCA approval for signage:
                    </p>

                        <h3>Determine Approval Requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            Confirm whether your signage type, location, and installation method require BCA approval.
                            Check with your landlord or building management as they often have this information readily
                            available.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Conduct Site Measurement</h3>
                        <p>
                            Accurate on-site measurements are critical. Measure the exact location, available mounting
                            points, clearances from fire exits/sprinklers, and building facade details. Incorrect
                            measurements are a leading cause of approval delays.
                        </p>

                            Create detailed technical drawings showing:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sign dimensions and materials</li>
                            <li>Installation method and mounting details</li>

                        <h3>Obtain Structural Calculations & PE Certification</h3>
                        <p>
                            For projecting signs, large signs, or signs in high-wind areas, you'll need:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Structural load calculations</li>
                            <li>Wind load analysis</li>
                            <li>Professional Engineer (PE) certification and stamp</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This typically costs SGD 800-2,000 and adds 5-7 days to your timeline.

                        <h3>Secure Landlord Approval First</h3>
                        <p>
                            Most landlords require you to obtain their written approval BEFORE submitting to BCA. Submit
                            your shop drawings to building management and wait for their approval letter. This can take
                            7-14 days depending on the landlord.
                        </p>

                            <h4>3. Fire Safety Clearance Issues</h4>
                            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Signs blocking fire escape routes, too close to
                                sprinklers, or obstructing fire safety signage.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Ensure minimum clearances from all fire safety features
                                during site measurement. Highlight these clearances in drawings.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Generic "to be installed" notes without specific
                                mounting
                                method, fixing types, or load distribution.</p>

                                approvals or violate building regulations.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Cross-check dimensions with landlord approval before BCA
                                submission. Ensure consistency across all documents.</p>

                            <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Clarify PE requirements early. If in doubt, engage a PE —

                                BCA will issue comments explaining rejection reasons. You can revise and resubmit, but
                                this adds 2-4 weeks to your timeline. Address ALL comments completely in your

                                URA approval is required if your building is in a conservation area or if signage
                                affects
                                the building's facade in heritage zones. Check with URA or your landlord. URA approval
                                must
                                be obtained BEFORE BCA submission.

                                Technically yes, but it's not recommended unless you have experience with technical
                                drawings and BCA requirements. Most building owners require professional submissions and
                                PE certification anyway.

                                BCA approval is typically valid for 12 months from the approval date. If installation is
                                not completed within this period, you may need to resubmit or request an extension.

                        BCA approval doesn't have to be stressful. With accurate measurements, complete documentation,
                        and
                        professional guidance, most signage projects achieve first-time approval within 7-14 working
                        days.
